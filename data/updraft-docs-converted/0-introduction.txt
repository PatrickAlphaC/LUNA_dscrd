## The Future of Web3: A focus on Security

Welcome to the future of Web3 security; welcome to what is possibly the most comprehensive course on this subject ever created! As smart contract developers continue to bloom, it becomes imperative to ensure that the security scene keeps up. That‚Äôs the core focus of this guide - to level up the game and ensure a safer environment in the Web3 space.

> _"Security is one of the most important things to unlocking the future of Web3."_

With multiple detailed courses delivered in the past, dedicated to helping novice and intermediate smart contract developers enhance their skills. The accompanying study materials have garnered over 5.5 million views, making them the most-watched smart contract development courses on the planet. Thousands of budding developers have thus started their Web3 journey, equipped with the right knowledge and skills. They are now activated and productive developers in the Web3 space.

This guide, however, is not for the newcomers. It's an advanced course aimed at those familiar with smart contracts and comfortable with terms like _storage_, _self-destruct_, _fallback functions_, and _ERC20s_. A refresher will be offered at the beginning, but the primary focus will be to provide learners with intensive training in smart contract auditing and research.

## Expert Opinions Matter

It's always enriching to learn from the best, and this guide takes care of that too. Featuring guest lecturers who are renowned experts in smart contract development:

1. Josselin from Trail of Bits
2. Owen from Guardian Audience
3. Andy from Sigma Prime
4. Johnny Time from Gingersec
5. Pashov, legendary security researcher.
6. Hans, one of the top competitive auditors.
7. Tincho, the former lead auditor at Openzeppelin.

With these experts by your side, not only will you gain in-depth insights, but also get to explore extensive and carefully curated code samples. A special shout-out to Tincho, who has been actively supporting the development and auditing of the codes that will be discussed in detail.

## Mastering The Skills: Developer to Researcher

People planning to take up this course should have a basic understanding of blockchain basics, solidity fundamentals, and working with a smart contract framework such as Hardhat or Foundry. We will primarily focus on Foundry in this guide, but the skills learned can easily be transferred to other frameworks as well.

The course is not just for auditors; it is also aimed at training security researchers. Because who better to explore and learn about new attacks and analyze possible advances in smart contract technologies than a researcher?

The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23) associated with the course offers a detailed curriculum and additional resources. If you are already familiar with certain sections, feel free to skip directly to the ones that you need help with or wish to learn more about.

## A Peek into the Future

We want you to learn effectively, and that's where Cyfrin Updraft comes into play. It's a tool developed to HyperCharge your learning experience and help you grasp things faster. It‚Äôs free to sign up for those interested.

You are perfectly up to speed with the prerequisites if you have already taken the Foundry full course. Access more resources to get up to speed in the GitHub repo associated with the post.

### Section 0: Excercises

The first exercise is important. This is **just for you**. This isn't meant to be a motivation to share with others, or chat about publicly, this is what inspired you to take the first step and what will continue to inspire you to take the next.

_This is for you._

Make it as long and detailed as possible. Pour your emotion into defining why you want this. Don't bullsh\*t yourself. There'll be opportunities to shout your accomplishments loudly - but this is just for you.

üéØ Exercise: `Write yourself a message about why you want this`

This will be important for when things get hard
Is it money? Save web3? Become someone?
Write down as many reasons as possible.

## The Current State of Web3 Security: A Crucial Call to Action!

The current state of Web3 security is pretty objectively terrible. Let's look at where we're at and what needs to be done to improve security in the industry.

### A Shocking Reality: Billions Lost in Hacks

- **Billion-Dollar Troubles:** Did you know in 2022 alone, a jaw-dropping $3.1 billion was stolen in crypto hacks? And 2023 isn't looking much better. It's a call to arms for all of us in the Web3 space!
- **DeFi's Dilemma:** Imagine this - about 7% of DeFi's total value is getting swiped by hackers. That's like saying, "Hey, deposit your money here, but there's a scary chance it might vanish!"

### Attack Patterns: The Usual Suspects

**Top Threats:**

- Price oracle manipulation
- reward manipulation
- stolen private keys

These represent only a few of the common attack vectors we see lately. Some vulnerabilities have been around for years and _still_ people are making these mistakes - I'm looking at you _reentrancy_. There's a clear lack of best practices and we need to push back!

There's an amazing newsletter, every serious security researcher should sign up for called [Block Threat Intelligence](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/) by Peter Kacherginsky.

Just recently (as of October, 2023), we've seen multi-million dollar hacks, just in the last couple months.

### The Big Picture: How do we move forward?

- **Mainstream Hesitation:** With all these risks, no wonder big financial players are tiptoeing around Web3. It's incumbent upon us to make this space safer for mainstream adoption. How do we do accomplish this?
- **Reducing the Risk:** It's simple - fewer hacks, more trust. More security focused education, fewer hacks.

### The Bright Side: The future of Web3 Security

Security in Web3 is improving every day.

1. More and more people are moving into the security space in Web3. More auditors, more experts, more...safe!
2. Education is improving in Web3 Security and Web3 as a whole. People are more informed of best practices and what to watch out for
3. Tooling is improving - with AI and constantly developments in static analysis and vulnerability aggregation - we've never been more equipped to improve security in the space. [Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/) in particular is a tool we'll come back to again and again in this course.

**Protocols Playing It Safe:** More and more Web3 protocols are investing in security. They're auditing their code, they're opening bug bounties for post deployment coverage, they're finally realizing that spending $1 Million on security now, is worth saving $100 Million in being hacked.

We also have an increase of pre-deployment experts like:

- Cyfrin
- Trail of Bits
- OpenZeppelin

Competitive audit platforms ([CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com/)), independent security researchers like ([Pashov](https://twitter.com/pashovkrum)) and a greater security focus all come together to make me optimistic about the future of Web3 Security.

### Yet, There's More to Do: Our Collective Mission

- **Centralized Technology** is a big problem. Private keys being compromised, or offchain centralizing are regular vulnerabilities seen in the space.
- **Lack of Post Deployment Practices** is something we'll cover later in the course. But needless to say, active monitoring practices and emergency triage in Web3 leave much to be desired. Few even leverage bug bounties to incentivize ongoing security on their protocol post launch.
- **Not Following Best Practices**
- **A Disconnect** seems to exist between the industry and security professionals. Audit(security review) != 100% Safe. If no one is reading the security reports, no one is any safer.

### Wrapping Up: Your Role in Shaping Web3's Destiny

This isn't just a course. It's a mission. Together, we can transform Web3 into a fortress of trust and innovation. Keep going for some exercises to sharpen your skills.
